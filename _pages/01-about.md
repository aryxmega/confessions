### I'm Ary &mdash; an American-Indonesian father and fianc&eacute; from Los Angeles, California ü§ô

During business hours, I'm a [product designer and front-end developer][url-career]. After hours, I'm either spending time with my adventure partner, bedroom lover and best fuckin' homey, Alexandra, and our son, Arro, or working on my newest project, [Candy](https://candymotor.co).

### Why 'AWWWRY'?

People usually pronounce my name as `/air-eee/` or `/are-eye`, so I chose the word awry to solve that phonetic issue and added two extra Ws because, being a nerd, I needed the initials from world wide web sandwiched in my name.

### How I get around

I used to brap around on a '99 Harley-Davidson Sportster, but sold it because after Arro was born, I only had time to jam around the city about once a month, I was seeing/reading more and more accidents on my feed and, straight up, I needed the money at the time ‚Äî this ninja had mad bills and shit.

Now I truck around in a 2017 Ford F-150 and I love beastin' it on the road and in compact parking spaces. I have a few more mods to do, but for now she's hella thicc.
