**Fuck Yeah, Campfest** is a weekend camping trip to celebrate Ary's bachelor party (AKA a buck's night, according to Google) of good times with legit homies.

***

### Where we meeting?
- Saturday, March 7th, between 8-8:30 AM at Denny's in El Monte

- Kickstands up and hittin' the road at 9 AM

***

### Where we going?

- [Hidden Valley Campground][url-hidden-valley] in Joshua Tree

> Jumbo Rocks and the other campsites that allow reservations are all booked up on Saturday, so once we hit Joshua Tree, we're going straight to **Hidden Valley Campground** to find and secure a spot since it's one of the few campgrounds inside Joshua Tree National Park that's first-come, first-served.

***

### Once we secure a site and set-up camp, we'll do one, some or all of the following:

- Go hiking
- Take sexy ass group shots of us to post on social (pants optional)
- Explore [Pioneertown][url-pioneertown]
- Hit up Applebee's, the hardest biker bar in town
- Cuddle (for warmth bros, for warmth)
