title:  "Engagement Photos"
---

Alexandra and I drove up to [Mountain Home Desert Retreat](https://mtn-home.org) where we met up with my homie, [David Bowles](https://davidscottbowles.com), and his amazing wife, Nia, to take our engagement photos.

Dawg, the location was so sick. It was out in the middle of nowhere at this historic piece of property that definitely captured the desert vibes we were looking for.

David really knows how to capture moments; he's got a good eye and Nia knows how to give dope directions for each shot. They're a super rad team. They made the whole experience supes chill and natural.

Wish I could pick 'em all, but here are a few of my favorite shots from our shoot:
