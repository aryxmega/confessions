### Development

To run the theme locally, go to the theme's directory and run `bundle install` in Terminal (or any command line interface) to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to fire-up the Jekyll server.

Check out the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll's website to see your creation on the internets.

### Create Posts

To create a new post, you can create a new markdown file inside the `\_posts` folder by following the [recommended file structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files).

      ---
      layout: post
      title: "Awe shit, Jekyll in the house, y'all!"
      image: '/assets/img/jekyll.jpg'
      tags: [life, case-studies]
      ---

You can set the tags and the post image.

Add post images to **/assets/img/** directory.

For tags, try to not add space between two words, for example, `Ruby on Rails`, could be something like (`ruby-on-rails`, `Ruby_on_Rails`, or `Ruby-on-Rails`).

* * *

### Google Analytics

To integrate Google Analytics, open `_config.yml`, and add your Google Analytics identifier.

    # Google Analytics
    google-analytics: # Add your identifier. For example UA-931139315-1


* * *

### Update Favicon

You can find the current favicon (favicon.ico) inside the theme root folder â€” just replace it with your new favicon.
